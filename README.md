# HealthyBrainPipe

This repository houses the scripts necessary to analyze brain imaging genetic data. For this project, we identify significant genetic SNPs associated with brain imaging locations that are highly associated with specific reading disability (dyslexia, as quanitified via behavioral assessment scores).

We will be testing three relevant regularized regression approaches (Ridge, lasso, and elastic net) on brain imaging genetic data to determine the best approach for extracting significant genetic SNPs. 

We will be using three different data types: whole genome data, MRI brain scans, and two clinical reading scores.
